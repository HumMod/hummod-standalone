   ANP is a 28 amino acid protein
   of molecular weight 3060.

   1 pMol/L = 3 pG/mL

   A typical arterial blood level
   is 20 pMol/L.

   Data is from Lohmeier, but I don't
   have the reference.

The integral ANPPool.Mass jitters at Dx ~ 9. I'll try a backward
Euler integral here.

  Change = Gain - Loss
  Loss = K * Mass

With a backward Euler,

  Change = F1 - F2 * Integral

so

  F1 = Gain
  F2 = K
