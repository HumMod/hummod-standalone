   The renal interstitial pressure
   is proportional to the renal
   perfusion pressure (arcuate
   artery).

   Normal interstitial pressure is
   4.0 mmHg.  Normal arcuate artery
   pressure is 94 mmHg.

   Olsen's data suggests a pressure
   natriuresis that is prominent at
   high pressures.

   Fractional Na+ and Li+ reabsorption
   decrease together, indicating a
   proximal site of action.  Downstream
   segments would then also decrease
   fraction due to increased Na+ flow.

   If the site of action is inside the
   TGF loop, it would be blunted by
   adjustments in filtration.  And
   in fact, pressure natriuresis only
   becomes evident when AII infusion
   has no additional effect -- that is,
   the TGF effect has reached its upper
   limit and can make no additional
   adjustments.
