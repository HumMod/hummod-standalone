Foods in the lumen are

   Carbohydrates
   Fat
   Protein

Carbohydrates ===================================

Typical lumen mass is 1930 mG on an intake of 0.15 mG/Min.

We postulate good absorption of small amounts of glucose.

Normal values are

   Mass - 1930 mG
   Absorption - 150 mG/Min
   Permeability - 0.08 / Min

      
After an oral load, plasma glucose rises steadily for an hour and
then insulin kicks in an balances absorption and tissue uptake.

   JCI 78:472, 1986

It appears that absorption of an oral glucose load is slowed by
the gut's maximum absorption rate.

1 L of 5% glucose adds 50,000 mG and may be absorbed over 100 Min,
making the maximum 500 mG/Min.

Fat ===================================

Typical lumen mass is 1990 mG on an intake of 0.06 mG/Min.

Protein ===================================

Typical lumen mass is 1600 mG on an intake of 0.08 mG/Min.
