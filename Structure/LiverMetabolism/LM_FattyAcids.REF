   Glucose targets for continuous
   feeding (drip) in mG/Min are

   Absorption = 152
   To Tissue = 90
   Degradation = 12
   Net Liver = 50

      Glycogenesis = 75
      Glycogenolysis = 75

      Gluconeogenesis = 25
      To FA = 75

   75 mG glucose goes to 31.5 mG
   of FA.

   Liver glucose uptake is
   modulated by an insulin effect
   and a concentration effect.

      [Glu] = 110 mG/dL normally

   Amino acid absorption is 80 mG/Min.
   Normal disposition (mG/Min) is as
   follows

      To Cells    = ~0
      To Glucose  = 42
      To FA       = 34
      Decomposing =  4

   Liver amino acid uptake is
   modulated by an insulin effect
   and a concentration effect.

      [AA] = 50 mG/dL normally

   The stoichiometry is 48 mG of
   amino acids will make 21 mG of
   FA.

      STOICHK = 21 / 48 or 0.437
