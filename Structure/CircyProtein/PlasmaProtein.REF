This model assumes that plasma protein (ie. albumin) is
synthesized and catabolized in the liver and is exchanged
with the plasma in the liver sinuses.

Guyton says that whole-body protein turnover is 400 G/Day
and about 3% is plasma protein.

Plasma protein turnover would be 12 G/Day or about 0.01 G/Min.

I'll put 210 G in the plasma.
