The cell SID is estimated to be 0.036. This is a long
way from Stewart's (1981) estimate of 0.130.

Stewart thought there were plenty of strong cations
(K+ = 0.144, Na+ = 0.010, Mg++ = 0.010) electrically
balanced by weak acids (A- = 0.118) creating a large
SID. The weak acids were presumably proteins.

Guyton thought that a similar mix of strong cations
was balanced by strong anions, naming phosphates and
other organic anions. Protein played a lesser role.

Experimental evidence suggests a rather low cell SID.
The evidence is pH changes when CO2, acid microinjection
and lactate generation during exercise.
