Seizure is used here as a synonym for colvulsion.

The effect of temperature on brain function is
as follows.

      deg C  deg F  Event
      -----  -----  -----------------------
      37.0    98.6  Normal temp.
      40.5   104.9  Highest temp in exer.
      41.0   105.8  Brn func starts down.
      41.5   106.7  Loosing consciousness.
      42.0   107.6  Convulsions.
      44.0   111.2  Convulsions stop.
      45.0   113.0  Protein denatured.
      45.0   113.0  Brn func is 0.

We postulate convulsions in the temperature band from
42.0 C to 44.0 C.

Simlarly, lack of brain fuel will trigger convulsions.

   Effect   Event
   ------   ----------------------------
    1.00    Normal.
    0.80    Convulsions start.
    0.50    Convulsions stop.
