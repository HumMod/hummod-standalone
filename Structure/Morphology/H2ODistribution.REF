I'll scale to a 77.5 kG (171 Lbs) male.

There are 12 organs. Additional weight is found in blood
volume.

Other includes lungs, esophagus, spinal cord, adrenals,
thyroid, miscellaneous tissues and fluids.

The density of this composition is 1.055. For organs
where no specfic information is available, the H2O
fraction is 0.677, the solid fraction is 0.323 and the
solid density is 1.17.

SKELETON

Skeleton is 59% bone and 41% marrow. By weight, the bone
is 88% bone mineral with a density of 2.3. The marrow
is 40% solids with a density of 1.00.

Skeleton 11075  3508   7566       4230  7738

The density of whole skeleton is 1.43.

FAT

Fat is mostly lipid deposits with a density of 0.905.
There are also some non-lipid solids with a density of
1.38. The H2O fraction is 0.15, the lipid fraction is
0.80 and the other solids fraction is 0.05.

Density is 0.93.

SKIN

The ICRP book has skin at 3.71% of body weight.

Some other references have a larger percent, but they
probably got some of the fatty subdermis. This should
be in adipose tissue.

  J.Biol.Chem. 203:359, 1953.

Skin is 61% H2O with a solid density of 1.36.

     ----- ----- ----- -----
Skin  2868  1749  1118  2571

Skin keeps most of its H2O in the interstitium.
Interstitial fraction is 0.87 while organ fraction
is 0.13. Skin has a density of 1.12.

SKELETAL MUSCLE

Skeletal Muscle is 75% H2O.

  Harmer. JAP 89:1793, 2000.
  Sullivan. JAP 77:2194, 1994.

The size of muscle interstitium needs more work.
Published values seem too small.

Peripheral H2O is IFV plus organ H2O. This is total
body H2O minus plasma volume and red cell H2O.

Total protein is 17.2% of wt and contractile protein
is 12.4% of wt.

BRAIN

Wt is 2107 G. H2O is 77.4. Spinal cord is 27 G and is
now in other tissues.

HEART

Wt. is 332G. H2O is 72%.

Total protein is 16.5% of wt. Contractile protein is
probably the same as skeletal muscle.

Total heart volume in diastole is reported to be
843 mL, but this seems too large. I'll look into
it. Suggested values are

LIVER

Wt is 1830G. H2O is 71%. IFV may be 27.5% of
liver volume.

KIDNEY

Wt is 310 G. H2O is 76%. Density is 1.050.

Fraction of peripheral H2O in IFV is variable. Default
value is 0.3. Fraction H2O in organ is also variable.
Default is 0.7.
