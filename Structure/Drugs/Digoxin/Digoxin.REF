Tabs are 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, and
0.5 mG.  Usually one dose a day
is enough.

Oral priming dose: 0.75 - 1.25 mG.
Oral maintenance dose: 0.125 - 0.5 mG.

MW = 780.92

Plasma conc is nG/mL.

   1.5 - Excellent Therapeutic
   2.0 - Nauseated
   2.5 - Likely V-Fib

Mass is uG. Conc is nG/mL.  So
divide by a volume of distribution
of L to get conc, since

   uG/L = nG/mL

Volume of distribution is very
large, about 700 L.

Bioavailability is 75%.  We'll take
the rest out in the GI lumen.

Digoxin is filtered and secreted by
the proximal tubule.

Loss tau is 56 hours or 3377 Min.  Loss
rate constant (/Min) is 0.0002968.

With a volume of distribution of 700 L,
this is a clearance of 207 mL/Min.
Divide it up into GFR and secretion.

Clearance (mL/Min)

Split the rate constant in the same
proportion.

   Filtration  0.000178 (GFR * [Conc])
   Secretion   0.000118 (x Mass)
               --------
   Total       0.000296               */
