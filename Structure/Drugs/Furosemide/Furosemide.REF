Mass is mG. Conc is uG/mL.  So
divide by a volume of distribution
of L to get conc, since

   mG/L = uG/mL

Clin. Pharm. Ther. 24:199-207, 1978.
J. Pharm. Biopharm. 7:265-274, 1979.

Volume of distribution is 110 mL/kG,
which is 57% of ECFV.

Loss rate constant is (/Min)

   Total = 0.02
      Renal = 0.01
      Non-Renal = 0.01

Maximum excretory effect occurs at
1 mG/L which is 8.5 mG in 8.5 L of
ECFV.  Renal secretion is 0.08 mG/Min
at this concentration.

Parenteral administration: 20 mG
in 2 mL and 100 mG in 10 mL.

Typical dose is 20 - 40 mG.  Repeat,
as needed, after 2 hours.

MW = 330.75

Plasma conc is uG/mL.

Mass is conserved between injectate
and ECFV when integral is an Euler.
Integration error changes only the
time constant -- not mass balance.
This is not true of a backward Euler.

Injection timespan is specified
in seconds.  Time span is 2 time
constants.
