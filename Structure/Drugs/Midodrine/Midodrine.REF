Midodrine comes with an HCL that it may
lose in the gut.  Then in the ECFV it
loses a glycine to become the active
desglymidodrine.

   MidodrineHCL    290.74
   HCl              34.46
   Midodrine       254.30
   Glycine          75.07
   Desglymidodrine 179.23

Tabs are 2.5 and 5.0 mG.  Typical dose
is 10 - 30 mG/Day.

Best units for mass is probably uG.  [Conc]
is usually reported in nG/mL which is also
uG/L.

Volume of distribution is quite large at
308 L. But I used smaller values in the
model -- must have found a better reference.

Three things happen when the tabs go into
the gut.

# Physical units go from mG to uG.
# The bioavailability (93%) is dialed in.
# Midodrine HCl (290.74) loses its HCl (34.46)
  to become Midodrine (254.3).                 */

NIPHCL 254.3 / 290.74 or 0.875

Total scale is 1000.0 * 0.93 * (254.3 / 290.74)
or 1000 * BIOVAIL * NIPHCL.

When midodrine (254.3) goes across to desglymidodrine
(179.23) a glycine gets nipped (75.07).

NIPGLYCINE = 179.23 / 254.3 or 0.705
