These sums use mEq/L.

The cations are all strong ions.

  [Na+] 144.0
  [K+]    4.5
        -----
  Total 148.5

The anions are mostly strong ions.

  [CL-]   107.0
  [KA-]     0.0
  [Lac-]    1.0
  [SO4--]   0.3
  [PO4--]   0.2
          -----
  Total   108.5

The weak anion is [HCO3] at 28.

  Strong  108.5
  [HCO3-]  28.0
          -----
  Total   136.5

The remainder of the anion gap is filled with
protein at 12.0

  Strong  108.5
  Weak     28.0
  Protein  12.0
          -----
  Total   148.5

The SID is strong cation minus strong anion. We also
need a SID value in mEq/mL.

CALCULATION SEQUENCE

We can't calculate all of the ion sums at once.
Calculate SID first. It's value is then used to
calculate [HCO3]. Then return here to finish sums.
