Lactate is a little tricky because it is both a fuel and a strong
anion.

We use mEq for acid-base and mG for fuel.

A lactate is one-half of a glucose molecule less a H+.

On a weight-weight basis, one mG of glucose produces 0.99
mG of lactate.

Glucose M.W. = 180
Lactate M.W. = 89

Using molecular weights, 1 mG lactate = 0.0112 mEq.
