The cell protein pool is typically 6000.0 G. This
pool slowly exchanges aminoacids with the circulating
amino acid pool.

An adequate protein pool supports cell function.

Normal concentration is 214 G/L or mG/mL.

Clin.Sci. 33:507, 1967 has protein turnover at 150
mG/Min. Guyton (p880) has it at 280 mG/Min. A good
estimate is 200 mG/Min or 0.2 G/Min.

The circulating AA pool drives inflow while cell
protein concentration drives outflow. There is also
cellular degradation.

I'm going to try mG as the unit for mass. It is a very large
number, but the rates are just right.

Mass = 6000000.0

[Protein] = 215 mG/mL

Inflow = 232.0 mG/Min
Outflow = 200.0 mG/Min
Degradation = 32.0 mG/Min

[Pool Protein] = 50.0 mG/dL or 0.50 mG/mL

InflowK = 464.0
OutflowK = 0.93
DegradationK = 0.0000053
