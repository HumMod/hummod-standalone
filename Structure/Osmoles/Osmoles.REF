It appears that CO2 moves so quickly that [HCO3-] is not
osmotically active. This creates [Osm] total and [Osm]
active, with the difference being [HCO3-].

Strong salts such NaCl dissociation completely but
electrical forces make a molecule pair slightly less
that two osmotic particles. The incomplete dissociation
constant on average is 0.934. For NaCl, it is 0.90.

Urea diffuses rapidly but can cause transient osmotic
effects, such a during dialysis.

Nominal values follow.

  [Osm] Total = 288.0
  [Osm] Active = 264.2

  Total Osmoles = 12170
    Extracellular = 4250
    Intracellular = 7920

Nominal volumes are

  Body H2O = 43.0
    ECFV = 15.0
    CellH2O = 28.0

Extracellular osmoles break down as follows.

  Total = 4250

  Cations = 2236
    Na+ = 2170
    K+ = 66

  Anions = 1637
    Cl- = 1610
    Lac- = 23
    KA- = 1
    SO4-- = 2
    PO4-- = 1

  Other Osmoles = 375
    Glucose = 92
    Urea = 93
    Unknown = 190

Cell osmoles break down as follows.

  Total = 7920

  Cations = 4340
    K+ = 3980
    Other 360

  Anions = 3340

  Other Osmoles = 244
    Urea = 174
    Unknown = 70

Cell anions are not well developed at this time. The many
proteins are anions but are not really osmotically active.
I calculate anions as cations minus 1000.
