The circulating amino acid pool is typically 7500 mG. The
volume of distribution is the ECFV or 15000 ml. This
yields a concentration of 50 mG/dL.

Pathways include

# Uptake from GI tract lumen.
# Hepatic uptake for gluconeogenesis.
# Hepatic uptake for triglyceride synthesis.
# Exchange with cell protein pool.
# Pool degradation.
