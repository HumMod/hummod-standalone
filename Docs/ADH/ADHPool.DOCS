ADH concentrations have been expressed in

   pG/mL
   pMol/L
   uU/mL

A typical concentration is 2.0 pG/mL; 1.8pMol/L or 0.8uU/mL
To change from pG to pMol multiply by 0.922
To change from pG to uU, multiply by 0.4

Antidiuretic hormone(also known as vasopressin or AVP,a nonapeptide, 
is synthesized in the magnocellular neurons of the paraventricular
and supraoptic nuclei. Its release is stimulated by increased osmolality
and by reductions in blood volume and blood pressure. 
Increased ADH secretion causes increased fluid reabsorption by the
kidneys, helping to restore blood pressure and blood volume toward normal. 

When the osmolarity of the body fluids increases above normal,
the posterior pituitary gland secretes more ADH, which increases
the permeability of the distal tubules and collecting ducts to water.
This allows large amounts of water to be reabsorbed and results 
in increases in blood volume and decreases in urine volume.
An increase in extracellular fluid osmolarity causes special 
nerve cells called osmoreceptor cells, located in the anterior 
hypothalamus near the supraoptic nuclei, to shrink. This  shrinkage 
causes the cells to send nerve signals to the supraoptic nuclei which
stimulates the release of ADH from the posterior pituitary. A second
neuronal area important in controlling osmolarity and ADH secretion 
is located along the anteroventral region of the third ventricle, 
called the AV3V region. At the upper part of this region is a structure 
called the subfornical organ, and at the inferior part is another structure 
called the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis. Between these two 
organs is the median preoptic nucleus, which has multiple nerve connections
with the two organs as well as with the supraoptic nuclei and the blood 
pressure control centers in the medulla of the brain. 

ADH release is also controlled by cardiovascular reflexes in response to
decreases in blood pressure and/or blood volume including the arterial
baroreceptor reflexes and the cardiopulmonary reflexes. 

The ADH pool is [ADH]*ECFV.  Typical [ADH] is 2.0 pg/ml and ECFV is 15,000ml 
2.0pG/ml*15,000ml =30,000pG mass or 30nG (AJP 252: R635, 1986)
 
ADH is secreted into this pool by the pituitary and generally cleared from the pool by the liver and the kidneys. Typical ADH secretion is 3.2nG/min.

With severe hemorrhage and hypotension, it is likely that the clearance of vasopressin from the circulation will be reduced because of decreased blood flow to the kidneys and splanchnic viscera, the organs resposible for the removal of vasopressin from the circulating blood.

   Normal synthesis and secretion
   rates are 3.2 nG/Min into and
   out of the fast pool.

   The fast mass is 3200 nG, making
   the fractional secretion rate
   0.001 /Min.

   The slow mass is 17000 nG.

   Fluxes between the fast and slow
   pools is 17 nG/Min, defining these
   2 rate constants.

      SlowToFast - 0.0010 /Min
      FastToSlow - 0.0053 /Min

       Neural stimulation of ADH release
       seems to come primarily from the
       baroreflex.

   I favoring the idea that there is little
   tonic neural stimulation of AVP release.

   Hemorrhage causes a big stimulus.  Brain
   death only decreases AVP moderately.
   Trauma to the hypophysis will decrease
   AVP more.
