RBCs normally circulate an average of 120 days 
before being destroyed. As the cells age, the 
cell membrane becomes more fragile and the cells 
rupture during passage through some tight spots 
in the circulation, particularly in the spleen.

RBCs are comprised of solids and water. 
Typical RBC volume is 2400mL with 1580mL 
being water and 820mL being solids.

RBC concentrations have been expressed number per 
cubic millimeter and as a % of the blood volume 
(hematocrit).

A typical hematocrit is 44% for males and 40% for females

A typical concentration is 5,200,000 (plus or minus 300,000)in 
males and 4,700,000 (plus or minus 300,000) in females

A typical RBC secretion and clearance rate is 0.014mL/min

K is the rate constant 
K = 1/Tau
K = 1/120*1440
Since tau is in days and clearance is expressed in minutes, 
multiply tau by 1440.
