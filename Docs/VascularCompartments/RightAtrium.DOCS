   secretion rate of XX ng/min.

   Volume of distribution is ECFV,
   which is 15000 mL.

   Initial ECFV pool is 30 nG or
   30000 pG.

   Normal synthesis and secretion
   rates are 3.2 nG/Min into and
   out of the fast pool.

   The fast mass is 3200 nG, making
   the fractional secretion rate
   0.001 /Min.

   The slow mass is 17000 nG.

   Fluxes between the fast and slow
   pools is 17 nG/Min, defining these
   2 rate constants.

      SlowToFast - 0.0010 /Min

       Neural stimulation of ADH release
       seems to come primarily from the
       baroreflex.

   I favoring the idea that there is little
   tonic neural stimulation of AVP release.

   Hemorrhage causes a big stimulus.  Brain
   death only decreases AVP moderately.
   Trauma to the hypophysis will decrease
   AVP more.
