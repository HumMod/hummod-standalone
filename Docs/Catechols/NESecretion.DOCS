Norepinephrine (NE) is the neurotransmitter released 
from axon terminals of sympathetic postganglionic neurons. 
Norepinephrine is also released from the adrenal medullae 
in response to sympathetic nerve stimulation. Increases 
in adrenal nerve activity cause increases in the release
of NE from both nerve endings and from the adrenal medullae.
Under resting conditions, only a few percent of the NE 
entering the plasma represents adrenal medullary secretion. 
The remainder has its source in the neurotransmitter released 
by sympathetic nerve varicosities. This NE is referred to 
as spillover. Total body spillover can be measured using a 
tracer kinetic method based on dilution of [3H]NE by endogenous NE.
During stress responses e.g. acute glucodeprivation, the adrenal 
contribution to plasma NE levels greatly increases.

In the model, the adrenal nerve effect is quantified as a 
multiplier of the base secretion.

NE excites both alpha and beta adrenergic receptors and causes
a range of different effects in different effector organs 
depending on the plasma concentration and the density and types 
of receptors present. In patients with pheochromocytoma, an 
increase in plasma NE causes symptoms which include 
hypertension, severe headaches, palpitations and excess sweating. 
These symptoms reflect the effects of norepinephrine 
on alpha and beta adrenergic receptors respectively.

Base secretion is typically 220nG/Min
Spillover = SpilloverK*GangliaGeneral.NA(Hz) 
SpilloverK is 570nG/Min
GangliaGeneral.NA(Hz) = 1.5
Spillover = 570 * 1.5 = 840nG/Min

Base secretion is the rate of secretion from the adrenal 
medullae when the adrenal nerve effect is 1.0.

Secretion Rate = Base*Adrenal Nerve Effect*OtherTissue-Function.Effect

Since control of secretion is a function of membrane transport, 
the effect of ph, protein, fuel and temperature are important 
factors. These are classified as other tissue -function 
and act as a multiplier effect. Under normal physiological conditions, 
OtherTisse-Function.Effect has a value of 1.0.

Under resting conditions, most of the NE entering the plasma
comes from NE released by sympathetic nerve varicosities. 
This NE is referred to as spillover. Total body spillover 
can be measured using a tracer kinetic method based on dilution 
of [3H]NE by endogenous NE. 

Spillover is a function of ganglionic nerve activity. Under 
initial conditions, post-ganglia nerve activity is 1.5Hz.

Spillover = Spillover K* GangliaGeneral.NA(Hz)
