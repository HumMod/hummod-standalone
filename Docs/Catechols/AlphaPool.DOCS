The alpha pool is the quantity of stimulated alpha receptors.
Under resting conditions the effect of alpha pool stimulation
is 1.0 and norepinephrine and epinephrine make roughly equal
contributions to the alpha pool.

<label> Adrenergic Receptors Overview </label>
<content>

There are two major types of adrenergic receptors, alpha 
receptors and beta receptors. Alpha receptors can be subdivided 
into alpha 1  and alpha 2 receptors. Beta receptors can be 
subdivided into beta 1 receptors and beta 2 receptors. 
Norepinephrine and epinephrine have slightly different effects 
in exciting the alpha and beta receptors. Norepinephrine excites 
mainly alpha receptors but excites beta receptors to a lesser 
extent as well. Epinephrine excites both types of receptors 
approximately equally. Therefore the relative effects of 
norepinephrine and epinephrine on different effector
organs are determined by the types of receptors in the organs.
Furthermore certain alpha functions are excitatory, whereas 
others are inhibitory. Likewise certain beta functions are 
excitatory and others are inhibitory. Therefore, alpha and beta 
receptors are not necessarly associated with excitation or 
inhibition but simply with the affinity of the hormone for the 
receptors in the given effector organ.

<name> NESCALE - Definition1 </name>
<label> Definition </label>
<content> 

NESCALE is a constant which relates plasma levels of 
norepinephrine to alpha agonism. Together with EPISCALE,
normal plasma levels of epinephrine and NE are mapped to
an alpha agonism of 1.0.

<label> Definition </label>
<content>

Since alpha receptors see both epinephrine and norepinephrine, 
the blood concentration of Epi and NE do not quantitate their
effect on alpha receptors. In the model NE and Epi contribute 
equally to alpha agonism and normal plasma concentrations of 
NE and Epi are mapped to an alpha agonism of 1.0. This is done 
by using two constants NESCALE and EPISCALE to calculate NEPart 
and EpiPart respectively.

MidoPart is used to calculate the effect of the alpha agonist
midodrine on the alpha pool. It is a function of the amount of
the active metabolite of midodrine, desglymidodrine and is 
calculated using the following formula:
 
MidoPart = DesglymidodrinePool.[Desglymidodrine]*MIDOSCALE
