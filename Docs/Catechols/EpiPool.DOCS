In 1895, Oliver and Schaefer first showed that a substance 
present in the adrenal gland was pressor. This substance was 
subsequently shown to be epinephrine.

Stimulation of the sympathetic nerves to the adrenal 
medullae causes release of both epinephrine and 
norepinephrine into the circulation. Catecholamines 
exert their effects by stimulating specific protein 
receptor sites known as adrenergic receptors. There are 
two types of adrenergic receptors, alpha and beta receptors.
Epinephrine excites both types of receptors.

The epinephrine pool or mass is a function of epinephrine 
secretion, epinephrine clearance and the volume of distribution
which is the ECFV.

Epinephrine (C9 H13 N O3) has a molecular weight
of 183. Typical plasma concentration is 40pG/mL.
or 0.22nMol/L (Multiply by 0.00546 to convert pG/mL
to nMol/L).

<name> Change - Definition </name>
<label> Definition </label>
<content>

Changes in the Epi pool or mass are a function of both 
gains and losses in epinephrine over time. Gains may 
occur from increased secretion due to increased sympathetic 
nerve stimulation; from infusion of epinephrine
using the epi pump feature of the model and/or increases 
from a pheochromocytoma.

<topicdoc>
<name> F1 - Definition </name>
<label> Definition </label>
<content>

F1 is a mathematical variable used in the calculation of 
the mass of Epi. F1 is the gain in Epi over time and is 
a function of  Epi secretion rate, Epi pump rate and
pheochromocytoma Epi rate.

<topicdoc>
<name> F2 - Definition </name>
<label> Definition </label>
<content>

F2 is a mathematical variable used in the calculation of 
the mass of Epi. F2 is the loss in Epi over time and is 
a function of  Epi clearance rate.

<topicdoc>
<name> Gain - Definition </name>
<label> Definition </label>
<content>

Gain is defined as positive changes in mass of epinephrine 
and is a function of epinephrine secretion rate, 
epinephrine from infusion (using the Epi pump feature) and
any epinephrine secretion from a possible pheochromocytoma.
The model user may create a pheochromocytoma and 
define different levels of severity.

<name> Loss -Definition </name>
<label> Definition </label>

Loss is defined as a negative change in mass of epinephrine
and is a function of clearance rate and ECFV.

<name> InitialMass - Definition </name>
<label> Definition </label>
<content>

The initial mass is the starting amount of Epi. Since the 
plasma concentration is 40pG/mL (the target[Epi]) and the
volume of distribution is the ECFV (15,000mL), then the 
initial mass or circulating pool is 600nG or 600,000pG.

Initial Mass = Target[Epi]*ECFV.Vol

EpiPOOL
The Epi Pool or mass is a function of Epi Secretion, 
Epi Clearance and the volume of distribution. 
Since the volume of distribution for epinephrine is 
the ECFV (15,000 mL), the typical circulating pool
is 600nG or 600,000pG. This is the initial mass of Epi.

Changes in the Epi pool or mass are a function of both 
gains and losses in epinephrine over time. Gains may 
occur from increased secretion due to increased sympathetic 
nerve stimulation; from infusion of epinephrine
using the epi pump feature of the model and/or increases 
from a pheochromocytoma.  
Changes in the pool are calculated in the model using two 
mathematical variables, F1 and F2, which integrate gains and 
losses over time.
