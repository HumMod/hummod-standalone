# Radu's HumMod

You no longer need to fork a repo.  You can just clone this one and work.

```
> git clone git@github.com:HumMod/library.git
```

Once you have that done, change into that directory and checkout your branch:

```
> git checkout riliescu
```

Make all the changes you want. Don't forget to commit... 

```
> git add .
> git commit -m "Your message"
```

When you're ready to push the data back to Github, push it to your branch.

```
> git push origin riliescu
```

It's very important that your changes only happen on your branch and get pushed to your branch.  

When you want to merge something back into the master branch, submit a Pull Request.
