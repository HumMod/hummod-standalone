The tree is organized using parents, where the most senior parents are main
menu selections.

The senior parent menu names are compiled in. They are

   PHYSIOLOGY
   ORGANS
   LIFESTYLE
   CLINIC

Display data folders are oganized following the structure of the pop down
menus.

The display of the first panel is determined by the first panel parsed. Hence,
I include the Chart first to specify that it is displayed first. All other
includes are not significant.

Future plans call for a vertical, left-side window showing a collapsible tree
of all panels. Mulpiple panels can be displayed at one time with tabs used to
select the visible panel.
